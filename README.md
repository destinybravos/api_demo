# API DEMO APP
## A basic demostration on how HTTP Request and Api Works

Below are som guidelines on how to install and make use of the Demo App.

#### Database Tables
The project was made with the database table exported on the SQL files named "['api_db.sql']() on the root directory of the project. All you need to do is simply to create a database called "api_demo" on your local server, then import the file "['api_db.sql']() to it.
